# deep-learning-challenge

This repository is for module 21 challenge - deep-learning-challenge

The nonprofit foundation Alphabet Soup wants a tool that can help it select the applicants for funding with the best chance of success in their ventures. This analysis uses the features in the provided dataset to create a binary classifier that can predict whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.

1.Preprocess the Data:
  The purpose of this stage is to decide what variables are the targets and features for the model, and what variables can be removed because they are irrelevant
2.Compile, Train, and Evaluate the Model
  With thw knowledge of TensorFlow, a neural network, or deep learning model is designed, to create a binary classification model that can predict if an Alphabet Soup-funded organisation will be successful based on the features in the dataset. The model is compiled, trained, and evaluated to calculate the modelâ€™s loss and accuracy.
3.Optimise the Model
  Optimising the model to achieve a target predictive accuracy higher than 75%.
4.Write a Report on the Neural Network Model
  A seperated report is presented named Report.md in this repository.
